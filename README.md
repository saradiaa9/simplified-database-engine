# Simplified Database Engine

Simplified Database Engine is a Java-based database management system that allows users to create, read, update, and delete data in a simple and intuitive way. The system uses a simplified SQL syntax that is easy to learn and understand.

## Installation

To install Simplified Database Engine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/saradiaa9/simplified-database-engine.git`
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE, such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.
3. Build the project using Maven or Gradle, depending on your build system.

## Usage

To start the database engine, run the `DBApp.java` file in your IDE. 

The database supports the following SQL commands:

- `CREATE TABLE`: creates a new table with the specified columns
- `INSERT INTO`: inserts a new row into an existing table
- `SELECT`: retrieves data from one or more tables
- `UPDATE`: updates data in an existing table
- `DELETE`: deletes data from an existing table

## Acknowledgements

This project was inspired by the need for a simple and intuitive database management system, and by the many talented developers who have created similar projects before us. We also want to thank the Java community for their support and contributions to the open-source ecosystem.
